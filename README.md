# Project Idea
Our project name is Discord 2.0. It is a web based chating platform where a user will first get registered and then login to his account. User can also create his own channel and could chat with other people.

# Customer Dscription 
Our customer is the one who is looking for a real-time web based application to share their ideas and mesdssages with other people.
# Design Philosophy
Never assume a solution as the final Answer because nothing is final. Always try to work in interfaces as it is easy to modify smaller parts than whole program and clarity gives better understandig and better understanding means better modification.
